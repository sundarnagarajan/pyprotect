PY3:
    build-essential python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip
    To run tests,, additionally need python3-numpy

PY2:
    build-essential python2-dev python-pip python-setuptools

    cython3

All these dependencies are installed in a docker image that can
be built with scripts/Dockerfile using docker command:
    DOCKER_IMAGE='py23:jammy'
    docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE scripts

    Update scripts/config.sh with name of DOCKER_IMAGE

To build module in-place (under pyprotect) using docker container:
    PY3:
        ./scripts/build_PY2_PY3_in_place.sh PY3
    PY2:
        ./scripts/build_PY2_PY3_in_place.sh PY2

To run tests after building:
    PY3:
        ./tests/run_func_tests.sh PY3
    PY2:
        ./tests/run_func_tests.sh PY2
